### Multi-state Time-to-event models via Stan

This is an R package that fits multi-state time-to-event models via Stan. This is in all likelihood a temporary repository in work to contribute to the **rstanarm** package. Recent updates to the package include LOO/WAIC in the context of multi-state models, and model validation via weighted Brier score on each state.
Further extensions include joint longitudinal and multistate model.
